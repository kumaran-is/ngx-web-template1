## Quick Start

To launch the application on your computer, you can try below steps:

1. Clone repository and checkout the `master` branch

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kumaran-is/ngx-web-starter.git
    cd ngx-web-starter
    git checkout master
    ```

1. Install NPM dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Run linting and unit test

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    npm run test
    ```

1. Start application in development mode

    ```bash
    ng serve -o
    ```

1. Application opens in browser [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## Build Tasks and Commands

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular Official Site for Angular CLI Overview and Commands](https://angular.io/cli).

## Profiling the Build

The more the application grows, the slower the build gets. Angular CLI version 7.0.0 introduced a --profile flag that outputs the build events and lets you profile them in chrome://tracing. You can use this feature as follows:

1. Build your project with --profile flag on (ng build --prod --profile)
2. Angular CLI will produce a file called chrome-profiler-events.json
3. Open [chrome://tracing](chrome://tracing/) and click on “Load” in the top left corner
4. Select chrome-profiler-events.json
5. For more detail refer the [link](https://blog.mgechev.com/2019/02/06/5-angular-cli-features/)

## Webpack Bundle Analysis and Statistics

This repository is integrated with packtracker.io, which provids webpack bundle analysis and statistics on every pull request basis and establish performance budgets for your asset profile.

## Publish Angular Application to Github Pages

`Github Pages` is a Github feature that allows you to deploy any static website or web application or Angular application from your `gh-pages` branch to `Github Pages` for free

Using [angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) library, you can easily publish your angular application to `Github Pages`.

1. Install [angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) as a devDependency to your project

    ```bash
    npm install angular-cli-ghpages --save-dev
    ```

1. Add below npm script to your `package.json`

    ```bash
    "scripts": {
      ....
      .....
      "prod-build": "ng build --prod --base-href=./",
      "git-publish": "npm run prod-build && npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/ngx-web-starter --branch=gh-pages"
    }
    ```

1. Publish your application from `gh-pages` branch to `Github Pages`. Branch `gh-pages` is automatically created for you. Command below,
first runs production build, automatically commits and pushes the changes from 'dist' folder to `gh-pages` branch and deploys it to `Github Pages`.
Branch `gh-pages` act as a staging folder for deployment.

    ```bash
    npm run git-publish
    ```

1. Launch your application on browser by navigating to `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`. Example to launch this application click this link <https://kumaran-is.github.io/ngx-web-starter>

1. For more detail and options, refer the official [angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) github.

## GitHub Working Agreement

We will be working off the master branch. When working on a new feature or fixing a bug,
create a new branch out of the master branch and follow the below naming convention for the branch name.
Remember that GitHub and MacOS are case-sensitive. Our standard will be for all branch names and file
names to be all lower-case.

 - **For features**: feature/{feature-name}
    - Example:
                
            git checkout -b feature/auth_flow  # using feature name
 - **For bugs**: fix/{bug-name}
    
    - Example:
             git checkout -b fix/login_fails  # using  bug name
